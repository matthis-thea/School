Here are the things to know if you want to succeed in this exercise:
• Philosophers (one philosopher minimum) are seated around a round table at the
center of which is a large dish of spaghetti.
• Philosophers are either eating, thinking or sleeping.
When they eat, they cannot think or sleep.
When they sleep, they cannot eat or think.
Finally, when they think, they cannot eat or sleep.
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as
of philosophers.
• Since serving and eating spaghetti using a single fork is not
easy thing, a philosopher takes the fork on his left and the one on his right,
or a fork in each hand, in order to eat.
• When a philosopher has finished eating, he puts the forks back on the table and
puts to sleep. Once awake, he starts to think again. The simulation ends if a
philosopher is starving.
• Every philosopher needs to eat and must not starve.
• Philosophers do not communicate with each other.
• Philosophers cannot know if one of them is about to die.
• Needless to say that philosophers should not die!
