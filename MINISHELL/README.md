Minishell is a program that simulates the basic behavior of a command interpreter, similar to the UNIX shell. It provides the ability to run system commands, manage processes, and implement advanced features such as signal handling, I/O redirection, and pipes. It will have been necessary to manage the syntax of commands, the creation and management of processes, as well as the manipulation of data flows. This project is entirely coded in C.
